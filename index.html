        <p class="hero-lead">
          Many cards advertise “perks” – coffee discounts, streaming credits, airport benefits, partner offers.
          This page explains how those perks are structured, which ones actually matter, and how to tell if you’re paying
          too much for benefits you barely use.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Do Card Perks Actually Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        “Perks” is a broad marketing term. It can mean anything from a small discount at a coffee chain to
        full airport lounge access and hotel upgrades. Often, these perks are used to justify an annual fee
        or to differentiate one card from another when basic features (network, contactless, app) are similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        From your perspective, perks only have real value if they fit how you already spend money or travel.
        A generous perk in a store you rarely use is worth close to zero, while a modest but frequently used
        discount can quietly pay for the card over a year.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Types of perks -->
    <section id="types" class="section">
      <h2>Common Types of Credit Card Perks</h2>
      <p>
        Different cards bundle different mixes of perks. Typical examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Merchant discounts:</strong> Ongoing or rotating discounts at specific retailers, cafés,
          fuel stations or online shops.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription credits:</strong> Monthly or annual statement credits for streaming, food delivery
          or productivity services when you pay with the card.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel add-ons:</strong> Priority boarding, limited lounge passes, free checked bags or
          hotel late checkout.</li>
        <li><strong>Shopping perks:</strong> Extended returns, special sales access or extra loyalty points at select partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Category boosters:</strong> Extra rewards on groceries, dining, public transport or digital wallets
          for a limited time or up to certain caps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some perks are automatic, while others require manual activation in the card app or at the partner site.
        Missed activation is a common reason people fail to capture the full value.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & trade-offs -->
    <section id="value" class="section">
      <h2>How to Judge If Perks Are Worth It</h2>
      <p>
        To evaluate card perks, you need to estimate how often you’ll realistically use each benefit and translate that
        into a rough yearly value.
      </p>
      <p>Questions to ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do I already pay for the services covered by credits (e.g. streaming or delivery)?</li>
        <li>Are partner discounts at places I regularly shop, or just nice “extras” I might forget?</li>
        <li>Is there a minimum spend or usage condition to unlock the full perk value?</li>
        <li>Would I still want this card if the headline perk disappeared next year?</li>
        <li>Does the total perk value, after realistic usage, offset or exceed the annual fee?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A card with modest but predictable perks you actually use can be more valuable than one with flashy,
        rarely used benefits that mostly serve as marketing.
